# Animal rehoming centre website - dynamic

This was a change from an old project where I made a static website which can be
found here [AnimalRehomingStatic](https://github.com/mikeismint/AnimalHavenStatic).  
In this version I made a dynamic version of the site using PHP and MySQL.  

I used a basic MVC style architecture, although there are no specific controllers.
All the controller logic is in `index.php` which also deals with routing.

One of the issues I wanted to address from the original 
[AnimalRehomingStatic](https://github.com/mikeismint/AnimalHavenStatic) was the
size of the single CSS file I used.

To address this problem I choose to use [SASS](http://sass-lang.com).
